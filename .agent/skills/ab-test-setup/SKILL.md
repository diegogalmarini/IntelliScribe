description: When the user wants to plan, design, or implement an A/B test or experiment, or build a growth experimentation program. Also use when the user mentions "A/B test," "split test," "experiment," "test this change," "variant copy," "hypothesis," "should I test this," "which version is better," "test two versions," "statistical significance," "how long should I run this test," "growth experiments," "experiment velocity," "ICE score," or "experiment playbook." Use this whenever someone is comparing two approaches and wants to measure which performs better. For page-level conversion optimization, see page-cro.

# A/B Test Setup

You are an expert in experimentation and A/B testing. Your goal is to help design tests that produce statistically valid, actionable results.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agent/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Before designing a test, understand:
1. **Test Context** - What are you trying to improve? What change are you considering?
2. **Current State** - Baseline conversion rate? Current traffic volume?
3. **Constraints** - Technical complexity? Timeline? Tools available?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Start with a Hypothesis
Not just "let's see what happens." Specific prediction of outcome, based on reasoning or data.

### 2. Test One Thing
Single variable per test. Otherwise you don't know what worked.

### 3. Statistical Rigor
Pre-determine sample size. Don't peek and stop early. Commit to the methodology.

### 4. Measure What Matters
Primary metric tied to business value. Secondary metrics for context. Guardrail metrics to prevent harm.

---

## Hypothesis Framework

### Structure

```
Because [observation/data],
we believe [change]
will cause [expected outcome]
for [audience].
We'll know this is true when [metrics].
```

### Example

**Weak**: "Changing the button color might increase clicks."

**Strong**: "Because users report difficulty finding the CTA (per heatmaps and feedback), we believe making the button larger and using contrasting color will increase CTA clicks by 15%+ for new visitors. We'll measure click-through rate from page view to signup start."

## Test Types

| Type | Description | Traffic Needed |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| A/B | Two versions, single change | Moderate |
| A/B/n | Multiple variants | Higher |
| MVT | Multiple changes in combinations | Very high |
| Split URL | Different URLs for variants | Moderate |

---

## Sample Size Quick Reference

| Baseline | 10% Lift | 20% Lift | 50% Lift |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 1% | 150k/variant | 39k/variant | 6k/variant |
| 3% | 47k/variant | 12k/variant | 2k/variant |
| 5% | 27k/variant | 7k/variant | 1.2k/variant |
| 10% | 12k/variant | 3k/variant | 550/variant |

---

## Metrics Selection

### Primary Metric
Single metric that matters most. Directly tied to hypothesis. What you'll use to call the test.

### Secondary Metrics
Support primary metric interpretation.

### Guardrail Metrics
Things that shouldn't get worse. Stop test if significantly negative.

**Example: Pricing Page Test**
- **Primary**: Plan selection rate
- **Secondary**: Time on page, plan distribution
- **Guardrail**: Support tickets, refund rate

## Running the Test

### Pre-Launch Checklist
- [ ] Hypothesis documented
- [ ] Primary metric defined
- [ ] Sample size calculated
- [ ] Variants implemented correctly
- [ ] Tracking verified
- [ ] QA completed on all variants

### The Peeking Problem
Looking at results before reaching sample size and stopping early leads to false positives. Pre-commit to sample size and trust the process.

---

## Analyzing Results

### Analysis Checklist
1. Reach sample size? If not, result is preliminary
2. Statistically significant? Check confidence intervals
3. Effect size meaningful? Compare to MDE, project impact
4. Secondary metrics consistent?
5. Guardrail concerns?

### Interpreting Results

| Result | Conclusion |
|--------|------------|
| Significant winner | Implement variant |
| Significant loser | Keep control, learn why |
| No significant difference | Need more traffic or bolder test |
| Mixed signals | Dig deeper, maybe segment |

## Growth Experimentation Program

### The Experiment Loop

```
1. Generate hypotheses (from data, research, competitors, customer feedback)
2. Prioritize with ICE scoring
3. Design and run the test
4. Analyze results with statistical rigor
5. Promote winners to a playbook
6. Generate new hypotheses from learnings
→ Repeat
```

### ICE Prioritization

Score each hypothesis 1-10 on:
- **Impact**: If this works, how much will it move the primary metric?
- **Confidence**: How sure are we this will work?
- **Ease**: How fast and cheap can we ship and measure this?

**ICE Score** = (Impact + Confidence + Ease) / 3

### Experiment Velocity

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Experiments launched per month | 4-8 for most teams |
| Win rate | 20-30% is common for mature programs |
| Average test duration | 2-4 weeks |
| Backlog depth | 20+ hypotheses queued |

## Common Mistakes

- Testing too small a change (undetectable)
- Testing too many things (can't isolate)
- Stopping early
- Cherry-picking segments
- Over-interpreting inconclusive results

---

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What's your current conversion rate?
2. How much traffic does this page get?
3. What change are you considering and why?
4. What's the smallest improvement worth detecting?
5. What tools do you have for testing?
