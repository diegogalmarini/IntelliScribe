# 💡 Diktalo Innovation & Ideas Backlog

This document serves as a repository for future enhancements to the Diktalo experience, specifically focusing on the SupportBot and user engagement.

## 🤖 SupportBot Enhancements

### 1. Agent Referrals (Smart Handoff)
- **Concept**: Agents should recognize their own limitations. If a sales agent (Isabella) hits a technical wall, they should offer to "call" a specialist (Alex or Klaus).
- **Status**: 🚧 Under implementation (Implementing Switch Action).
- **Goal**: Realistic "human-like" team dynamics.

### 2. Tailored CTAs & Personalities
- **Concept**: Different agents use different conversion strategies.
- **Example**: Isabella (Sales) offers limited-time discounts or trials. Klaus (Technical) highlights data security and API robustness.
- **Goal**: Increase conversion through psychological tailoring.

### 3. Sentiment-Driven Escalation
- **Concept**: Analyze user messages for frustration.
- **Action**: If a user is angry, the bot should automatically escalate to a "High Priority" email or even notify the founder directly.
- **Goal**: Prevent churn through proactive support.

### 4. Behavioral A/B Testing
- **Concept**: Use the 8 agents as 8 different "Landing Pages" for a product.
- **Metric**: Track which personality type (formal vs informal, technical vs creative) converts better for different user segments.

## 🚀 Product Features

### 1. AI Template Suggestion
- **Concept**: If the bot detects a user is a doctor (via their audio titles), it should proactively suggest the "Medical" summary template.

### 2. Voice-Activated Handoff
- **Concept**: Integration with the upcoming Voice features where users can say "Let me talk to Nati" and the UI switches instantly.
