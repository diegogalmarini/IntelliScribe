# Control Panel & Preferences

Diktalo is not a static tool; it is a customizable personal intelligence engine. In this panel, you will configure how the AI interacts with you and processes your data.

### Transcription Language (Input Language)
This is the **most critical** setting for result quality.
*   **Auto-Detect:** Ideal if you record conversations in different languages frequently. The AI will listen to the first few seconds and decide the acoustic model.
*   **Force Language (e.g., Spanish):** Recommended if you *know* you will always speak in Spanish. Eliminates the possibility of detection errors in noisy environments.

### User Interface
*   **Dark Mode:** Optimized for professionals working long hours in front of screens or in low-light environments. Reduces visual fatigue and energy consumption on OLED screens.

## Privacy and Trust

### Data Control
Diktalo operates under a principle of radical transparency.
*   **Total Export:** You have the right to request a full dump of your data in standard format (GDPR Compliance).
*   **Right to be Forgotten:** You can execute the permanent deletion of your account. This action purges your audios and transcripts from our inference servers and cold storage.

### Trust Center

## Troubleshooting

**Incorrect Time Zone**
The dates of your recordings are normalized to UTC on the server but are displayed according to your browser settings. If you see discrepancies, check your operating system's clock settings, not Diktalo's.

**Email Change**
For security and data integrity reasons, changing the root email is not self-manageable. If your company has changed domains, contact *support@diktalo.com* for an assisted migration.
