## Recording Flow

### 1. Start Capture
The extension automatically detects the audio source of the active tab.
*   **Record Tab:** Captures system audio (ideal for videos, podcasts).
*   **Record Meeting:** Optimized for platforms like Meet/Teams.

### 3. Visual Snapshots
In addition to audio, the extension allows you to take **Visual Snapshots** of the meeting. These images will be automatically attached to the final note in your Dashboard, giving you visual context of what was being presented at that moment.

## Automatic Synchronization

Upon completion, the recording is immediately uploaded to your Diktalo cloud. In seconds, you will receive the transcript and analysis in your Dashboard, ready to be reviewed along with any notes or snapshots you took during the session.
