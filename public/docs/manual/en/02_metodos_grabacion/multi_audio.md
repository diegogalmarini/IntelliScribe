# Multi-Audio and Speaker Assignment

**Multi-Audio** mode is an advanced feature designed for professional recording scenarios where each participant has their own dedicated microphone, generating separate audio files.

## Why use Multi-Audio?

In a single-track recording (mono or stereo mix), if two people speak at the same time, voices overlap and transcription can suffer. With **Multi-Audio**, Diktalo receives each voice on a clean channel.

*   **Perfect Diarization:** The AI knows exactly who is speaking because each file corresponds to a unique speaker.
*   **Better Quality:** Eliminates background noise from other microphones when a person is not speaking.

## How to setup a Multi-Audio session

1.  Record your session using a multi-channel recorder or separate audio interfaces.
2.  In Diktalo, go to **Upload File**.
3.  Toggle the **"Multi-Track Mode"** switch.
4.  Upload the individual files (e.g., `John.mp3`, `Mary.mp3`).
5.  **Assign tags:** The system will ask you to type the speaker name for each uploaded file.
6.  Process the session.

The result will be a single combined transcript with 100% speaker identification accuracy.
