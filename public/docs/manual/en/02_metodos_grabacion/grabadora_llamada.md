## Step by Step

1.  Access the **Dialer** in the side menu.
2.  Enter the destination number.
3.  The call will start and recording will begin automatically (or on demand, depending on your settings).
4.  Upon hanging up, the audio will appear in your recent recordings list ready to be transcribed.

> **Privacy Notice:** Always ensure compliance with local call recording laws ("One-party" vs "Two-party consent"). Diktalo recommends always informing the other party that the call is being recorded.
