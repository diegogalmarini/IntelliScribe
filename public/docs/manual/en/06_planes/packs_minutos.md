# Extra Minute Packs

Run out of time in your monthly plan? Don't worry! You can now purchase permanent **Minute Packs** to keep transcribing without interruptions.

## What are Minute Packs?

Packs are one-time purchases that add a minute balance to your account. Unlike your monthly subscription minutes, pack minutes **never expire**.

## How do they work? (Consumption Order)

Diktalo manages your time intelligently so you always get the most out of your subscription:

1.  **Plan minutes are used first:** Each month you receive a specific amount of minutes based on your plan (e.g., 300 min). Since these minutes reset at the end of the cycle, the system prioritizes them.
2.  **Pack minutes are used second:** Only when you have completely exhausted your monthly plan minutes will the system start deducting time from your "Extra Minutes" balance.

This way, your purchased minutes act as a "safety net" that is always there when you need it.

## How to buy a Pack

1.  Go to the **Plans and Subscription** section in your Dashboard.
2.  Look for the **"Need more minutes?"** section.
3.  Choose the pack that best fits your needs and click **"Buy Pack"**.
4.  You will be redirected to the secure payment gateway. Once completed, the minutes will be instantly added to your profile.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Minute pack purchases are reserved for users with an active subscription (Pro or Business). If you are on the free plan, you must upgrade your account before you can acquire extra minutes.

## View my balance

You can check your "Extra Minutes" balance at any time from the subscription tab. A box will appear indicating how many permanent minutes you have available.
