# ASK Diktalo: Conversational Intelligence

**ASK Diktalo** is not a search engine; it is an expert analyst that has listened to your conversation and remembers even the smallest detail. It is the interface that allows you to "dialogue" with your data.

Using Large Language Models (LLMs) trained in business contexts, ASK Diktalo can extract, synthesize, and reason about the information contained in your recordings.

## The 3 Levels of Intelligence

The power of ASK Diktalo scales according to the scope of data you need to analyze.

### Level 1: MICRO (Single Session)
**"Analyze THIS recording."**

The chat lives within a specific recording. Its universe of knowledge is limited to what was said in that session.
*   **Question:** *"Did they mention any deadline for the project?"*
*   **Question:** *"Draft a follow-up email for the client based on this talk."*
*   **Precision:** Maximum, as the context is closed and controlled.

---

### Level 2: MACRO (Multi-Session Project)
**"Analyze THIS project."** *(Coming Soon)*

The chat understands the context of an entire folder or tag. It crosses information between multiple related meetings.
*   **Question:** *"How has the client's opinion on pricing evolved over the last 3 meetings?"*
*   **Question:** *"Summarize the weekly progress of the Marketing team."*

---

### Level 3: GLOBAL (Second Brain)
**"Analyze ALL my knowledge."** *(Enterprise)*

The engine connects dots between departments, years, and teams. Finds patterns that a human would never see due to the volume of data.
*   **Question:** *"Tell me all the times we discussed 'Cybersecurity' in the last year, regardless of which client it was with."*

## Assistant Capabilities

### 🧠 Hard Data Extraction
Forget about frantically taking notes. Ask for the exact data.
> *"List all prices mentioned by the provider."*
> *"Give me the names and titles of the attendees."*

### 💡 Creative Synthesis
Transform the format of information.
> *"Turn this meeting into a blog post."*
> *"Create a comparison table of the pros and cons discussed."*

### 🔎 Sentiment Detection
Read between the lines.
> *"What was the tone of the investor's response when we talked about risks?"*
> *"Was there any moment of tension in the call?"*

## Prompt Engineering (How to ask)

To get "Senior Consultant" level results, formulate your questions with context and objective:

**❌ Basic:**
*"Make a summary."*

**✅ Pro:**
*"Act like a Project Manager. Based on the transcript, generate a list of tasks prioritized by urgency, assign an owner to each one, and detect any blockers mentioned that prevent progress."*

---

## Verifiability (Citations)

Trust is key in AI. That's why every answer from ASK Diktalo includes **clickable references**.
*   If the chat claims: *"The client accepted the budget"*, you will see a small index `[12:40]`.
*   Clicking it, the player will jump to the exact second where that phrase was said, allowing you to **audit the hallucination** and verify the original source.
