# AI Summary Templates

**Intelligence Templates** are the structured brain of Diktalo. They don't just summarize; they **transform** your recordings into knowledge assets ready to be shared, archived, or executed.

Each template trains the AI with a specific "role" (e.g., Lawyer, Project Manager, Journalist) to extract exactly what you need.

## How to Boost Your Results

1.  **Clear Audio = Smart AI:** Although Diktalo is powerful, audio with less echo improves speaker identification accuracy.
2.  **Mention "Actions":** If you explicitly say *"We agreed that John sends the email on Tuesday"*, the AI will detect it as a Task with date and owner automatically.
3.  **Experiment:** Don't be afraid to process the same recording with two different templates (e.g., "Executive" for your boss and "Detailed" for your archive) using the **Regenerate** function.
